Here's a `README.md` you can include in your project to document **Assignment 1 (Math Assistant Agent)** and **Assignment 2 (Multi-Tool Travel Assistant)** clearly:

# 🧑‍💻 AI Agent Assignments

This repository contains two assignments focused on building **LLM Agents** that interact with external tools for problem-solving. The goal is to understand **tool usage, decision-making, and orchestration** in AI agent systems.

## 📝 Assignment 1: Math Assistant Agent

### Problem Definition

Create an **LlmAgent** that can solve **basic math problems** using a **CalculatorTool** instead of relying only on the LLM.

### Features

* **CalculatorTool**: supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* The agent parses user queries like:

  * `"What is 12 × 15?"`
  * `"Add 56 and 89"`
* If the query is math-related → delegate to the calculator.
* Otherwise → fallback message:

  > "I can only help with math problems for now."

## 📝 Assignment 2: Multi-Tool Travel Assistant

### Problem Definition

Create an **LlmAgent** that helps with **travel-related queries** using multiple tools.

### Tools Implemented

1. **WeatherTool** → returns weather info for a given city (mock or API).
2. **FlightTool** → returns dummy flight information between two cities.

### Behavior

* User: `"What’s the weather in Paris tomorrow?"` → use **WeatherTool**
* User: `"Find me a flight from Delhi to Bangalore"` → use **FlightTool**
* User: `"Plan a weekend trip to Goa"` → use **both tools** (weather + flights) and summarize

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add API keys (if required) to `.env` files inside `assignment1/` and `assignment2/`.

## 🚀 Usage

### Run Assignment 1 (Math Assistant)

```bash
cd assignment1
python agents.py
```

### Run Assignment 2 (Travel Assistant)

```bash
cd assignement2
python travel_agent.py
## ✅ Learning Outcomes

##adk web

* Understand how LLM Agents **interact with external tools**.
* Learn **task routing** between reasoning vs. execution.
* Build simple **multi-tool orchestration** with decision-making.
* Practice designing **agent pipelines** for real-world tasks.
